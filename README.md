This project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The dataset employed contains features derived from breast mass images, including attributes such as tumor size, texture, and shape characteristics.

The primary objective is twofold: first, to employ PCA for dimensionality reduction to capture the essential information from the dataset while reducing computational complexity, and second, to develop an accurate classification model using SVM to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.

 By leveraging these techniques, the project offers a powerful tool for accurately identifying malignant tumors based on various tumor characteristics, thereby aiding healthcare professionals in making informed diagnostic decisions.
